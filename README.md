# rat-a-tat-cat
A Java project I started working on a few days ago—an application that allows a user to either play a card game (against automated opponents) or run a simulation. The game I'm modeling is called Rat-A-Tat-Cat, and has been one of my family's favorites for years. 

Here's a link to the game rules: http://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/pdfs/Rules/Rat-a-TatCat-RULES.pdf. (I'm working on adding Javadocs to explain the logic behind the automated turn methods, but understanding how the game works should make my code make more.)

The user will be able to choose between two main tabs—either "Play" or "Simulate." The Play tab is currently unusable, but the Simulate tab is almost complete. Choose what each player considers a desirable card value, and push the "START" button to see if I beat my family!
